## Examples

You can open any example in the `examples` directory and try yourself by pressing `CMD/CTRL + P` and selecting `Show Graph`.

## Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

### `markdown-links.column`

- `active` – in the currently focused column.
- `beside` – other than the current.
- `one` (**default**), `two`, `three`, `four`, `five`, `six`, `seven`, `eight`, `nine` – respective editor columns.

## Changelog

Refer to the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) file.

## Roadmap

This is early development version. I am currently considering:

- automated tests
- dark theme support (+ auto detecting system's dark/light mode)
- zoom controls (`+` / `-` / `reset`)
- handling external URLs
- ignoring files or directories
- some directory controls within the graph view (adding, removing files)
- configurable simulation
- better examples
- optional autostart
